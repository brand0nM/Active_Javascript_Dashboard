# Active_Javascript_Dashboard
## Overview
Use D3 to read JSON data and store in an active dashboard, filtering by user selection. 

### Purpose
Vizualize the data with a bar, bubble and gauge chart using plotly; these plots will update based on selection.

## Demo
A server must be initiated for plotly to function; In development I ran a local server using python terminal commands.

 ## Summary
We were successful in creating a javascript dashboard; these functions read JSON data, plot the desired results, and listen for changes in the patients selection- if changes exist, then the results will be replot. To further improve this dashboard we could beautify the css.
